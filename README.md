# Assembly
Assembly is one of the fundamental pillars of programming and is considered as a middle level language.
It is a misconception to call C a low level language since the only low level language is machine code(Binary).
Assembly has various flavours based on the system you are using it on.
in no particular order:
 - x86\_64
 - arm
 - MIPS

# Assembling 
To assemble the source code to machine code we must use an assembler 
in this instance ill be using NASM a popular assembler for Unix like systems.
